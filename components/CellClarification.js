    const dataExplanation = <p>
        Your plan might already include unlimited data for the tablet.  Or, you might be asked to choose a plan for the tablet with a limited amount of monthly data.
        If you need to choose how much data to buy for the tablet, a good rule of thumb is that every gigabyte (GB) of "LTE" data works out 
        to roughly 1 hour and 15 minutes of talk-time over video chat.

            The tablet will come with a charging cable that is about 4 feet long.  Depending on your relative/friend's needs, you might want to buy an extra-long cable, so that the 
            device can charge in whatever spot would be most convenient for them to see/hear/reach it.
        </p>

        <p>
            I recommend <TrackedLink href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0763358FV">this $7.99 
            25-foot microUSB cable</TrackedLink> that I bought for my grandmother.  It's definitely overkill, but it will get the job done.

                        <strong className="highlight">UPDATED 4/24/2020:</strong> If you followed the previous version of this guide that recommended buying a tablet from 
                        Amazon, and you are now having trouble activating it on the AT&T network, 
                        shoot me an email at <TrackedLink href="mailto:help@tabletconnect.org">help@tabletconnect.org</TrackedLink> and
                        I'll walk you through the solution.
                    </p>

                    <p>------------------------------------</p>

                    <p>
                        Unfortunately AT&T doesn't offer any low-cost tablets. 
                        Thus, I recommend that you actually 
                        get <TrackedLink href="https://prepaid.t-mobile.com/product-details/alcatel-joy-tab/Metallic%20Black">this $168 tablet</TrackedLink> from 
                        T Mobile Prepaid instead, with its own separate plan.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        T Mobile Prepaid has data plans that start at $10/month for 2 GB of high-speed data, going up to $50/month for unlimited data. 
                        1 GB of high-speed data works out to roughly 1 hour and 15 mintues of talk time.
                        However, T Mobile is also offering 50 GB of high-speed data to all customers for free through May 13 due to COVID, 
                        and there is a chance that this will be extended.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Alternatively, if you would like to stick with AT&T in spite of the higher tablet cost, I recommend 
                        purchasing <TrackedLink href="https://www.att.com/buy/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s5e-64gb-black.html">this $479 tablet</TrackedLink>. 
                        In that case, if you want a longer charging cable, it will need to be a "USB-C" type cable.  
                        I recommend <TrackedLink href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Powerline-Double-Braided-Charging-Samsung/dp/B07VWLLBP1">this $13.99 10-foot USB-C cable</TrackedLink>.

                        I'm working on finding a solution now, and hope to have this part of the guide updated by Friday, April 24. 
                        In the meantime, I would recommend that AT&T subscribers hold off on following the instructions below. 
                        You might consider 
                        purchasing <TrackedLink href="https://prepaid.t-mobile.com/product-details/alcatel-joy-tab/Metallic%20Black">this $168 tablet</TrackedLink> from

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you already bought the tablet that I recommended below, and AT&T won't let you activate it, drop me a line 
                        at <TrackedLink href="mailto:help@tabletconnect.org">help@tabletconnect.org</TrackedLink> and
                        I'll help you get that resolved.

                        After the tablet arrives, call {this.state.carrier} and tell them you want to add a tablet to your cell phone plan.  
                        Ask them to send you a SIM card for it.  When you get the SIM card in the mail, insert it into the tablet, and youâ€™re good to go!
